I'm a Senior Software Engineer with over 5 years of experience, currently leading backend squads at **Itaú Unibanco**, the largest bank in Latin America. I specialize in building scalable, secure, and high-performance systems using **Java**, **Kotlin**, and **Go**.

Passionate about delivering real business value, I bridge the gap between product vision and engineering, working closely with PMs and designers. My leadership is grounded in autonomy, trust, and continuous improvement.
